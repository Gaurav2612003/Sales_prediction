# Sales_prediction

Project Overview
This project is a Sales Prediction System using Linear Regression, which helps estimate sales based on advertising spend in different media channels. The model is trained on a dataset containing spending on TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertisements and their impact on sales.

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Linear Regression)
Scikit-Learn (Model Training, Performance Evaluation)
Data Visualization (Pairplot, Heatmap, Scatterplot)
How It Works
Data Preprocessing: Load and clean the dataset (check for missing values).
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Visualizing relationships between advertising channels and sales using pairplots.
Identifying correlations using a heatmap.
Model Training:
Splitting data into training and testing sets.
Applying Linear Regression to predict sales.
Model Evaluation:
Calculating Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Sales Prediction:
Given a new set of advertising budgets, the model predicts the expected sales.
Future Enhancements
Implement Polynomial Regression or Decision Trees for better accuracy.
Deploy the model as a Flask or Streamlit web app.
Introduce more features like social media ad spend.
